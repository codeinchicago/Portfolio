    <p>Hello! Welcome to my little corner of the internet.</p>

    <div>
        I am Vance Cole, an aspiring software engineer based in Chicago. I am attending the <a href = "https://codingtemple.com/"> Coding Temple </a> bootcamp and will graduate July 8. <br>
        I am eager to start work in the field and was inspired to enter the field because I love problem solving and optimization.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading and playing board games. My favorite author is Graham Greene, and my favorite work of his is <i>The Power and the Glory</i>. <br>
    My favorite board game is <i>Spirit Island</i>, the cooperative settler destruction game. Find out more about it <a href = "https://greaterthangames.com/product/spirit-island/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>I have a tradition of making my laptop background an ant. Here is the current one:</p>
